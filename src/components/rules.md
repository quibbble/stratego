## Objective 🎯
Command your army and crush your opponent piece by piece.

## Components 🧱
- A 10 x 10 game board.
- 40 pieces per player, including:
  - 1 Flag (marked f)
  - 6 Bombs (marked b)
  - 1 Spy (marked s)
  - 6 Scouts (rank 1)
  - 5 Miners (rank 2)
  - 5 Sergeants (rank 3)
  - 4 Lieutenants (rank 4)
  - 4 Captains (rank 5)
  - 3 Majors (rank 6)
  - 2 Colonels (rank 7)
  - 1 General (rank 8)
  - 1 Marshal (rank 9)

## Setting Up 🏗️
1. Place the game board between the two players. 
2. Each player sets up their pieces on the last four rows on their side of the board with piece information facing the owner and hidden from the opponent. The two middle rows are left unoccupied.

## How to Play 🚀
What to do on your turn:

1. **Move a Piece:** On your turn, you can move one of your pieces one space to an adjacent empty square (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). Pieces cannot move onto or through lakes (the four central squares of the board). There are so special movement cases:
   - Bomb and Flag pieces cannot be moved.
   - Scouts may move unlimited spaces (horizontally or vertically) so long as they do not run through a lake or other pieces.

2. **Attack:** If your piece moves onto a square occupied by an opponent's piece, you reveal both pieces, and the lower-ranked piece is captured and removed from the game. If both pieces have the same rank, both are removed from the game. There are some special attack cases:
   - Any piece that attacks a Bomb (other than a Miner) is removed from the game along with the Bomb. If a Miner attacks a Bomb then the Bomb is removed and the Miner survives.
   - If a Spy attacked a Marshal the Marshal is removed from the game. The Spy must be the one to initiate the attack to win. If a Marshal attacks a Spy then the Spy is removed from the game and the Marshal is not.

## How to Win 🏆
The game is won by the player who successfully captures their opponent's Flag. In the event that you can no longer move or attack then your opponent wins.

  - 1 Spy (marked s)
  - 2 Scouts (rank 1)
  - 2 Miners (rank 2)
  - 1 General (rank 8)
  - 1 Marshal (rank 9)
